So still testing this out as the first blog post, will be trouble-shooting how to add a couple of images to this from a local connection, and see where that takes me.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
